TODO:

* Colours
* Scale pixel values to 0.0 - 1.0 before choosing a colour.
* Get some meaningful sample data for an area I know.
* Add markers for each of the points?
* Make the markers display their value on click?
* Figure out a neat way of using n nearest neighbours instead of all
* Create legend widget
* REGRESSION: Remove strip on right and bottom where pixel blocks are missed by iterating one more time in each direction  -- 14/01/2011, fmark

   
DONE:
* Increase opacity of IDW layer -- 13/01/2011, fmark
* Rather than calculating each x by x block (to reduce runtime), calculate a smaller grid and then resample linearly to create a smoother surface  -- 14/01/2011, fmark
* Figure out how to pass variables (such as power, pixelSize, etc.) into constructor instead of hard-coding them  -- 14/01/2011
