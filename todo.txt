TODO:

* Colours
* Scale pixel values to 0.0 - 1.0 before choosing a colour.
* Increase opacity of IDW layer -- 13/01/2011, fmark
* Remove strip on right and bottom where pixel blocks are missed by iterating one more time in each direction
* Add markers for each of the points?
* Make the markers display their value on click?
* Rather than calculating each x by x block (to reduce runtime), calculate a smaller grid and then resample linearly to create a smoother surface
   * SPEEDUP - experiment with the size to resample from
* Figure out a neat way of using n nearest neighbours instead of all
* Figure out how to pass variables (such as power, pixelSize, etc.) into constructor instead of hard-coding them
